Student Info Manager – Java Swing Project

📌 About

This is a simple Java project created during my first year as a Computer Science student. It served as my summer learning initiative, combining what I learned in school with some self-taught concepts I explored online. The goal was to practice object-oriented programming and user interface development using Java Swing and AWT.

Allows deletion and insertion of student records

Basic GUI functionality built with Java Swing

⚙️ How to Run

Download the .java file

Run the program (java ClassName)

💡 Make sure you have Java installed and set up in your system's PATH.

🔍 Challenges Faced

Designing the logic for student data input and retrieval

Debugging numerous runtime errors and testing the UI

Managing lengthy code within a single class

Understanding how to structure and run a functional GUI

🧰 Libraries and Tools Used
